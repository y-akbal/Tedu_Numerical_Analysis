# Tedu_Numerical_Analysis
This course is offered to data science master students (Fall 2022 - 2023), and is mainly about optimization methods used in data science. As I pace, I will upload the documents. 
The programming language used for labs is particularly chosen as Julia, as it rocks for numerical computations. Things are done from scratch as much as possible (apart from automatic differentiation).
